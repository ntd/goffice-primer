[`goffice`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/goffice) is a GNOME library
providing graph/chart/plot support, together with some other useful
features (e.g. I just discovered there is a canvas widget). The code
seems to be quite complete and it is well maintained but it lacks
documentation badly.

This repository contains some sample code I wrote trying to understand
how to use libgoffice for drawing dynamic graphs.
